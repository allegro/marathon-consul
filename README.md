# marathon-consul [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/marathon-consul.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/allegro/marathon-consul)[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/allegro/marathon-consul/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/allegro/marathon-consul)


Register [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/) Tasks as [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) Services for service discovery.

`marathon-consul` takes information provided by the [Marathon event bus](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/event-bus.html) and
forwards it to Consul agents. It also re-syncs all the information from Marathon
to Consul on startup and repeats it with given interval.

## Code

This project is based on

* [mesos-consul](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/mesos-consul)
* [marathon-consul](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/marathon-consul)

### Differences

* CiscoCloud/marthon-consul copies application information to Consul KV while
allegro/marathon-consul registers tasks as Consul services
(it is more similar to CiscoCloud/mesos-consul)
* CiscoCloud/mesos-consul uses polling while allegro/marathon-consul uses
[Marathon's event bus](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/event-bus.html)
to detect changes
* CiscoCloud/marathon-consul is no longer developed
(see [comment](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/marathon-consul/issues/17#issuecomment-161678453))


## Installation

### Installing from source code

To simply compile and run the source code:

```
go run main.go [options]
```

To run the tests:

```
make test
```

To build the binary:

```
make build
```

### Installing from binary distribution

Binary distribution of `marathon-consul` can be downloaded directly from [the releases page](https://github.com/allegro/marathon-consul/releases).
Download the build dedicated to your OS. After unpacking the archive, run `marathon-consul` binary. You can also add some [options](#options), for example:

```bash
marathon-consul --marathon-location=marathon.service.consul:8080 --sync-interval=5m --log-level=debug
```

### Installing via APT package manager

If you are a Debian/Ubuntu user, you can easily install `marathon-consul` as a `deb` package using `APT` package manager. Both `upstart` and `systemd` service managers are supported.
All releases are published as `deb` packages to [our repository at Bintray](https://bintray.com/allegro/deb/marathon-consul/view).

To install `marathon-consul` with `apt-get`, simply follow the instructions:

```bash
# add our public key to apt
curl -s https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=allegro | sudo apt-key add -
# add the repository url
echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/v1/content/allegro/deb /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/marathon-consul.list
# update apt cache
sudo apt-get -y update
# install latest release of marathon-consul
sudo apt-get -qy install marathon-consul
```

Run it with `service marathon-consul start`. The configuration file is located at `/etc/marathon-consul.d/config.json`.

## Setting up `marathon-consul` after installation

The Marathon [event bus](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/event-bus.html) should point to [`/events`](#endpoints). You can
set up the event subscription with a call similar to this one:

```
curl -X POST 'http://marathon.service.consul:8080/v2/eventSubscriptions?callbackUrl=http://marathon-consul.service.consul:4000/events'
```

## Usage

- marathon-consul should be installed on all Marathon masters, and subscription should be set to `localhost` to reduce network traffic
- Consul Agents should be available at every Mesos Slave, tasks will be registered at hosts their run on.
- Only tasks which are labeled as `consul` will be registered in Consul. By default the registered service name is equal to Marathon's application name. 
  A different name can be provided as the label's value, e.g. `consul:customName`. As an exception of the rule, for backward compatibility with the `0.3.x` branch, a value of `true` is resolved to the default name.
- Only services with tag specified by `consul-tag` property will be maintained. This tag is automatically added during registration.
- At least one HTTP healthcheck should be defined for a task. The task is registered when Marathon marks it's as alive.
- Provided HTTP healtcheck will be transferred to Consul.
- Labels with `tag` value will be converted to Consul tags, e.g. (note: `consul-tag` is set to `marathon`) `labels: ["public":"tag", "varnish":"tag", "env": "test"]` â†’ `tags: ["public", "varnish", "marathon"]`.
- The scheduled Marathon-consul sync may run in two modes:
    - Only on node that is the current [Marathon-leader](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/rest-api.html#get-v2-leader), `sync-leader` parameter should be set to `hostname:port` the current node appears in the Marathon cluster. 
      This mode is **enabled by default** and the `sync-leader` property is set to the hostname resolved by OS.
      Note that there is a difference between `sync-leader` and `marathon-location`: `sync-leader` is used for node leadership detection (should be set to cluster-wide node name), while `marathon-location` is used for connection purpose (may be set to `localhost`)
    - On every node, `sync-force` parameter should be set to `true`

### Known limitations

The following section describes known limitations in `marathon-consul`.

* In Marathon when a deployment changing the application's service name (by changing its `labels`) is being stopped, it changes app's configuration anyway.
  This means we loose the link between the app and the services registered with the old name in Consul.
  Later on, if another deployment takes place, new services are registered with a new name, the old ones are not being deregistered though.
  A scheduled sync is required to wipe them out.
